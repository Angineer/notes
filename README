To start a new notes session, run start_notes.sh. It will create a tmux session with the todo list, a regular shell, and the most recent notes pages open.

From within the notes session, run :!./new_page.sh to create a page for the current date and open it. You can also run it from the shell pane with ./new_page.sh. If the current date page is already open, you will just have 2 tabs of it.
